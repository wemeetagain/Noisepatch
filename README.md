This is a quick and dirty attempt at a django noisebridge website.

The core functionality will include:
 - calendar
 - to do
 - wiki
 - ticketing/issues
 - project management

We will pull from as many prebuild django apps as possible.
 - wiki - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wiki
 - to to - https://github.com/shacker/django-todo
 - project management - http://code.google.com/p/django-project-management/
